# Security Guide

## üîê Security Overview

This portfolio application implements several security measures to protect sensitive information and ensure secure operations.

## üö® Critical Security Notes

### Environment Variables
- **NEVER commit `.env.local` to git** - it contains sensitive credentials
- All sensitive configuration is stored in environment variables
- The `.env.local` file is already in `.gitignore`

### Required Environment Variables
```bash
# Supabase Configuration
SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-project-url
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE=your-supabase-service-role-key

# Admin Authentication
ADMIN_USER_ID=your-admin-username
ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH=sha256-hash-of-your-password
ADMIN_EMAIL=your-admin-email

# Email Service (Optional)
RESEND_API_KEY=your-resend-api-key
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Features

### 1. Authentication System
- **Admin Login**: Custom authentication with SHA-256 password hashing
- **OTP Verification**: Two-factor authentication via email
- **Session Management**: Secure session storage with expiration
- **No Hardcoded Credentials**: All credentials are environment-based

### 2. API Security
- **Input Validation**: All API endpoints validate input data
- **Error Handling**: Generic error messages to prevent information disclosure
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in protection against abuse
- **CORS Protection**: Proper cross-origin request handling

### 3. File Upload Security
- **File Type Validation**: Only allowed file types can be uploaded
- **Size Limits**: Maximum file size restrictions
- **Secure Storage**: Files stored in Supabase with proper access controls

### 4. Database Security
- **Row Level Security (RLS)**: Supabase RLS policies for data access control
- **Service Role**: Admin operations use service role with proper permissions
- **Anonymous Access**: Public read access with restricted write access

## üîí Security Best Practices

### For Developers
1. **Never hardcode credentials** in source code
2. **Use environment variables** for all sensitive configuration
3. **Validate all user inputs** before processing
4. **Implement proper error handling** without exposing system details
5. **Regular security audits** of dependencies and code

### For Deployment
1. **Secure environment variables** in production
2. **Use HTTPS** for all communications
3. **Regular credential rotation** for API keys
4. **Monitor access logs** for suspicious activity
5. **Keep dependencies updated** to patch security vulnerabilities

### For Users
1. **Use strong passwords** for admin accounts
2. **Enable 2FA** where available
3. **Regular password changes** for admin accounts
4. **Monitor account activity** for unauthorized access

## üö® Security Checklist

Before deploying to production:

- [ ] All environment variables are properly set
- [ ] No hardcoded credentials in source code
- [ ] HTTPS is enabled
- [ ] File upload restrictions are configured
- [ ] Database RLS policies are active
- [ ] Admin credentials are strong and unique
- [ ] Error logging is configured (without sensitive data)
- [ ] Dependencies are up to date
- [ ] Security headers are configured
- [ ] CORS policies are restrictive

## üîç Security Monitoring

### Logs to Monitor
- Failed login attempts
- File upload activities
- Database access patterns
- API rate limit violations
- Error occurrences

### Alerts to Set Up
- Multiple failed login attempts
- Unusual file upload patterns
- Database access from unknown sources
- High error rates
- Unusual traffic patterns

## üìû Security Contacts

If you discover a security vulnerability:

1. **DO NOT** create a public issue
2. **DO** contact the maintainer privately
3. **DO** provide detailed reproduction steps
4. **DO** allow reasonable time for response
