# My Portfolio - Supabase Migration Complete ✅

## 🎉 Migration Status: COMPLETED

Your portfolio has been successfully migrated to Supabase! All uploads now use Supabase Storage with proper delete functionality, and the admin panel shows real errors instead of silent failures.

## 🚀 What's Been Implemented

### ✅ Core Features
- **Supabase Storage Integration**: All files (CVs, images, papers, certificates) stored in Supabase
- **Real Error Handling**: Admin panel shows actual error messages (4xx/5xx status codes)
- **Node.js Runtime**: All API routes use `runtime = 'nodejs'` for proper file handling
- **Service-Role Client**: Server-side operations use `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE` for security
- **Fresh Data**: Main site always reads fresh data from Supabase (no caching issues)

### ✅ File Management
- **CV Upload/Delete**: English & Japanese CVs with proper storage cleanup
- **Profile Pictures**: Upload/delete with hero section updates
- **Project Images**: Upload/delete for project galleries
- **Papers**: PDF upload/delete with portfolio integration
- **Certificates**: Image/PDF upload/delete with metadata

### ✅ Technical Improvements
- **Storage Utility**: `extractAssetsKeyFromPublicUrl()` for proper file management
- **Portfolio Service**: Clean API for database operations
- **Diagnostic Route**: `/api/_diag` for one-click system health check
- **Build Success**: All TypeScript errors resolved, ready for deployment

## 🛠️ Next Steps: Deployment

### 1. Pre-deployment Verification
```bash
# Verify local build works
npm run build

# Check environment variables are set
echo $SUPABASE_URL
echo $SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE
echo $SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
```

### 2. Deploy to Vercel
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI if not already installed
npm i -g vercel

# Deploy to preview
vercel deploy

# Deploy to production
vercel deploy --prod
```

### 3. Post-deployment Testing
- [ ] Test CV upload/download/delete
- [ ] Test profile picture upload/delete
- [ ] Test image upload/delete
- [ ] Test paper upload/delete
- [ ] Test certificate upload/delete
- [ ] Verify admin panel shows real errors
- [ ] Check diagnostic route: `/api/_diag`

## 🔧 Environment Variables Required

Set these in your Vercel project (both Preview and Production):

```bash
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE=your-service-role-key
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
```

## 🧪 Testing Your Migration

### Admin Panel Tests
1. **Upload CV**: Should store in `assets/cv/` and update portfolio JSON
2. **Delete CV**: Should remove from storage and clear JSON
3. **Upload Images**: Should store in `assets/images/` and update portfolio
4. **Error Handling**: Try invalid operations - should see real error messages

### Main Site Tests
1. **Fresh Data**: Changes should appear immediately
2. **Downloads**: CV downloads should work from Supabase URLs
3. **Images**: Profile pictures and project images should display correctly

## 📊 Monitoring

### Vercel Logs
```bash
vercel logs <your-project> --since=1h
```

### Supabase Dashboard
- **Storage**: Check `assets` bucket for uploaded files
- **Database**: Monitor `portfolio` table changes
- **Logs**: Review RLS policy enforcement

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Upload Fails**: Check `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE` permissions
2. **Files Not Persisting**: Verify `assets` bucket exists and is public
3. **Build Errors**: Ensure all environment variables are set
4. **RLS Errors**: Check `read_portfolio_anon` policy exists

### Diagnostic Route
Visit `/api/_diag` on your deployed site to check:
- Environment variables
- Database connection
- Storage access

## 🎯 Success Criteria Met

- ✅ All uploads use Supabase Storage
- ✅ Deleting removes both Storage object and JSON data
- ✅ Admin shows real errors (no silent success)
- ✅ Routes use Node runtime and service-role client
- ✅ Main site always reads fresh Supabase data
- ✅ Build successful with no compilation errors
